Homeworks for "Introduction to Wireless Communication" course, Skoltech, 2020, term 1

### Description

This task is about comparison "Round Robbin" and "Best Channel Conditions" strategies for a scheduling in the wireless system (time-division multiplexing). Each user's channel based on Jake's model. For comparison following metrics were used (in relative units):

* Total amount of data, averaged by number of experiments.
* Spectral efficiency, averaged by number of experiments.
* Fairness, averaged by number of experiments.
* Load distribution by users and by slots (graphs, relative units).
* Dependence of fairness and data rate on the number of users (graph, relative units).
